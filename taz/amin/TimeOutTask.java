/**
 * Implement a Timeout Task Using Future
 * Objective: Write a program that submits a task using ExecutorService and Future.
 * The task should simulate a long-running operation (e.g., a 5-second sleep).
 * Add logic to attempt fetching the result with a timeout of 2 seconds.
 * If the task doesnâ€™t complete within the timeout, cancel the task and handle the cancellation properly.
 * <p>
 * Key Focus:
 * <p>
 * Use ExecutorService to submit a task.
 * Use future.get(timeout, TimeUnit.SECONDS) for timeout handling.
 * Implement task cancellation with future.cancel().
